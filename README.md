## Task #2 - create Hash Database
![Known bad files screenshot](image-2.png)
- Creating a hash database quickly filter out useful information, or in this case, not so useful information. With a hash database, we now know what hashes are irrelevant in this investigation.

## Task #3
![WinHex hash calculation](image-3.png)
- Hex editors are useful to identify name changes in a file by a criminal, which were done in an effort to fool investigators at the surface level. Since file contents will yield the same hash, a hex editor will offer a quick comparison of two files in question.

## Task #4
![Vigen√®re Decode screenshot](image-1.png)
- Bit shifting is an operation that requires moving a bit to the left or right, which will consequently change the hash significantly. Criminals can hide evidence by shifting a bit, creating unrecognizeable data. Understanding bit shifting can help restore data and unreadable files.
